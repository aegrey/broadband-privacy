## #DataRights

Broadband companies like Cox and Verizon shouldn’t be able to sell details about your private life without permission. You deserve the right to say if and how they can use your data. **Right now, the FCC is considering new rules to protect broadband users’ privacy and is taking comments from the public. Let's make sure they hear from us. Demand your right to choice, transparency, and security. Will you join us?**

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
=====================

##When consumers sign up for Internet service, they shouldn’t have to sign away their right to privacy.

On March 31st, the FCC voted in favor of releasing a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (called an “NPRM”) on “<a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-16-39A1.pdf">Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services</a>" to ensure consumers have the tools they need to make informed choices about how and whether their data is used and shared by their broadband
providers.

Shouldn't you have a say over how your personal details are used? Telephone networks have had clear, enforceable privacy rules for decades, and it's time for broadband networks to catch up.

## We have until June 27th to be heard.
